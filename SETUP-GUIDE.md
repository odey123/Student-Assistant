   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_...
   ```

3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/setup-assistant.js
   ```

4. The script will:
   - Create a vector store
   - Upload all knowledge base files
   - Update your assistant with file_search capability
   - Display success message

**Option B: Manual Upload via OpenAI Dashboard**

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/assistants
2. Find your assistant (ID: `asst_X7DVRdYmsdMh4NN7PJr2UHZq`)
3. Click "Edit"
4. In the "Tools" section, enable "File Search"
5. Upload all files from the `knowledge-base/` folder

5. Include relevant portal URLs and contact information when applicable
6. Be concise but comprehensive in your responses
7. Use the file search tool to find information from the knowledge base

- For urgent matters, recommend contacting the relevant department directly
```

7. Save the assistant

### Step 3: Test Your Assistant
