  - Return university info with thread data

- ⏳ Create `app/config/assistant-config.ts`:
  - Helper to get assistant ID by university
  - Fallback handling
  - Error messages

### 6. Setup Scripts
- ⏳ Update `scripts/setup-assistant.js`:
  - Accept university ID as command-line parameter
  - Read from `knowledge-base/{universityId}/`
  - Create university-specific vector store
  - Save assistant ID to environment

- ⏳ Create `scripts/setup-university.js`:
  - Streamlined single-university setup
  - Usage: `node scripts/setup-university.js unilorin`

- ⏳ Create `scripts/setup-all-universities.js`:
  - Batch setup for all enabled universities
  - Progress reporting
  - Error handling
  - Generate summary report

### 7. Environment Variables
- ⏳ Update `.env` to include:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=...
  UNILAG_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_...
  UNILORIN_ASSISTANT_ID=asst_... (to be created)
  # Add more as universities are enabled
  ```

### 8. Storage & State
- ⏳ Update localStorage schema:
  - Global university preference
  - University per chat history item
  - Recent university selections

- ⏳ Update chat history UI:
  - Group chats by university
  - Show university badge on each chat
  - Filter by university

### 9. Testing & Polish
- ⏳ Run setup script for UNILORIN
- ⏳ Test university switching
- ⏳ Test chat with UNILORIN assistant
- ⏳ Test persistence (localStorage)
- ⏳ Mobile testing
- ⏳ Error handling for missing assistants

---

## 📋 NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

### Step 1: Integrate Components into App
1. Wrap app with `UniversityProvider` in layout
2. Add `UniversitySelector` to chat header
3. Update API routes to accept university parameter

### Step 2: Run Setup for UNILORIN
```bash
# After updating setup script
node scripts/setup-assistant.js unilorin
```

This will:
- Create vector store with UNILORIN knowledge
- Create OpenAI assistant
- Save assistant ID to `.env`

### Step 3: Test the System
- Switch between UNILAG and UNILORIN
- Ask questions to both assistants
- Verify correct responses

## 🔧 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### How It Works:

```
User Selects University (UI, UNILAG, etc.)
         ↓
University Context Updates State
         ↓
Chat Component Receives University ID
         ↓
API Call: /api/threads/{threadId}/messages?university=unilorin
         ↓
Backend Routes to Correct Assistant
         ↓
UNILORIN Assistant (asst_xyz123) with UNILORIN Vector Store
         ↓
Response with UNILORIN-specific Information
```

### Key Features:
- **One API Key**: All 20+ universities use same OpenAI account
- **Separate Assistants**: Each university has dedicated assistant & vector store
- **Dynamic Theming**: UI colors change per university
- **Persistent State**: Remembers last selected university
- **Seamless Switching**: Change universities mid-conversation
