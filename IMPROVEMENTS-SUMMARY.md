# UNILAG Student Assistant - Improvements Summary

## Problem Identified
Your assistant wasn't answering UNILAG-based questions because it had **no knowledge base** - it was relying purely on GPT's general training data which doesn't include specific UNILAG information.

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 🎯 **1. Comprehensive Knowledge Base**

Created 6 detailed files with UNILAG information:

| File | Content | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `unilag-general.txt` | University history, faculties, facilities overview | General UNILAG information |
| `departments-and-hods.json` | All departments organized by faculty | Department lookup |
| `campus-facilities.txt` | Building locations, halls, services | Navigation and facilities info |
| `academic-procedures.txt` | Registration, fees, exams, results procedures | How-to guidance |
| `contacts-and-urls.json` | Portal URLs, contacts, social media | Quick access to resources |
| `faq.txt` | 50+ frequently asked questions | Common queries |

**Result**: Assistant now has 6 comprehensive documents to reference for UNILAG questions.

---

### 🔍 **2. File Search / Vector Store**

**Created**: `scripts/setup-assistant.js`

This script:
- Creates an OpenAI vector store
- Uploads all knowledge base files
- Enables file_search tool on your assistant
- Configures proper system instructions

**How it helps**: The AI can now semantically search through all UNILAG documents to find relevant information.

**To use**:
```bash
node scripts/setup-assistant.js
```

## Before vs After Comparison

### ❌ **BEFORE**
```
User: "Where is the admin block?"
Assistant: "I don't have specific information about UNILAG's
           admin block location. You should check the campus
           map or ask someone on campus."
```

### ✅ **AFTER** (once you upload knowledge base)
```
User: "Where is the admin block?"
Assistant: "The main administrative block at UNILAG is the
           Senate Building, located in the central area of
           the Akoka main campus. It houses the Vice
           Chancellor's office, Registrar's office, and
           Bursary department. It's easily accessible from
           the main campus entrance."
```
