IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. "NIL" Indicates:
   - No admission slots for that particular state/category
   - Or no qualifying candidates from that category

2. Meeting Cut-Off ≠ Automatic Admission:
   - Cut-off is the minimum requirement
   - Candidates are ranked by aggregate scores
   - Higher scores = Better chances

3. Post-UTME Is Critical:
   - Can significantly boost your aggregate score
   - Prepare thoroughly for your course subjects
   - Usually Computer-Based Test (CBT)

4. O'Level Grading Impact:
   - A1s and B2s score higher points
   - C4-C6 score lower points
   - One sitting preferred over two sittings

5. Check Admission Status:
   - JAMB CAPS Portal: https://www.jamb.gov.ng/efacility/
   - UNILAG Admissions Portal: https://admissions.unilag.edu.ng
   - Check regularly - admissions are in batches

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

Q: I scored 250 in JAMB. Can I get admission?
A: It depends on your course choice. Check the cut-off for your course. For very competitive courses (Medicine, Computer Science, Engineering, Law), you'll need excellent Post-UTME and O'Level scores too.

Q: What if my score is exactly the cut-off mark?
A: You qualify to apply, but admission isn't guaranteed. Higher-scoring candidates get priority.

Q: Can I change my course after JAMB?
A: Yes, UNILAG allows change of course during screening. Check admissions portal for procedures and deadlines.

Q: Does UNILAG accept two O'Level sittings?
A: Yes, but one sitting scores higher in the aggregate calculation.

Q: I'm from Lagos State. Will my cut-off be lower?
A: Possibly. UNILAG has catchment area provisions for Lagos, Ogun, Ekiti, Osun, Oyo, and Ondo states. Some courses have lower catchment cut-offs.

Q: When will I know if I'm admitted?
A: Admission lists are released in batches between August and November. Monitor JAMB CAPS and UNILAG portals regularly.

Q: What's the difference between Merit and Catchment?
A: Merit applies to all candidates nationwide. Catchment is for candidates from UNILAG's catchment states (may have slightly different cut-offs).
