Libraries: The Bodleian Libraries group is one of the largest library systems in the UK. The historic Bodleian Library itself (often referring to the Old Bodleian Library complex including Duke Humfrey's Library and the Radcliffe Camera) is a centerpiece. Other key libraries include the Taylor Institution Library (Modern Languages), Sackler Library (Classics, Art History, Archaeology), Social Science Library, Radcliffe Science Library, and numerous college libraries, each with significant collections.

Colleges: The defining feature of Oxford. There are over 40 colleges and Permanent Private Halls (PPHs). Undergraduates (and many graduates) are members of a college, which provides accommodation, dining, tutorials (small group teaching), libraries, common rooms, pastoral care, and social/sporting activities. Colleges are located throughout the city of Oxford.
