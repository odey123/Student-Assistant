Oxford fees consist of Tuition Fees (set by the University, varying for Home vs. Overseas students and by course) and College Fees (where applicable, contributing to college facilities and services, often included for undergraduates). Living costs are separate.

Undergraduate Tuition Fees (Per Year) - 2024/2025 Estimates for International Students:

Humanities, Social Sciences (most): ~£30,000 - £38,000

Sciences, Engineering, Maths: ~£40,000 - £48,000+

Medicine (Clinical years higher): ~£40,000 - £55,000+

Graduate Tuition Fees (Per Year) - 2024/2025 Estimates for International Students: Highly variable by course (Masters vs. DPhil/PhD, lab-based vs. non-lab). Can range from ~£28,000 to over £50,000+. MBAs are significantly higher.

College Fees: For undergraduates, this is usually covered within the main University fee structure for overseas students. Graduate students may pay a separate college fee if not living in college accommodation, or it's included in accommodation costs.

Living Costs: Estimated at ~£1,300 - £1,900 per month (covering accommodation, food, personal expenses, etc.), depending on lifestyle and college.

(Note: These are estimates. Precise fees are published annually on the Oxford University website under 'Fees and Funding'.)
