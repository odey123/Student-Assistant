Academic Excellence: Outstanding academic record is paramount. High grades in qualifications like A-Levels (e.g., AAA-A*A*A*), IB (e.g., 38-40+ points with high scores in Higher Levels), or equivalent international qualifications (e.g., high AP scores (5s), strong SAT/ACT scores - check current testing policy, high GPA).

Subject Requirements: Specific subjects required or recommended for the chosen course are crucial.

Admissions Tests: Performance in required tests (BMAT, LNAT, MAT, TSA, etc.) is a key shortlisting factor.

UCAS Personal Statement: An essay demonstrating genuine interest and aptitude for the chosen subject, relevant experiences, and independent thinking. It must be highly focused on the academic subject.

Teacher's Reference: A detailed academic reference from a teacher submitted via UCAS.

Interview Performance: Ability to think critically, analyze information, discuss ideas logically, demonstrate enthusiasm for the subject, and show potential to thrive in the tutorial system. Interviews are primarily academic.

English Language Proficiency: Non-native English speakers must meet high proficiency requirements (e.g., IELTS overall 7.5 with 7.0+ per component, or equivalent TOEFL/Cambridge scores).
