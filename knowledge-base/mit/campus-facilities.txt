Main Library System: The MIT Libraries comprise several specialized libraries across campus. Key locations include Barker Engineering Library (in the iconic Great Dome), Hayden Library (Humanities and Science), Dewey Library (Management and Social Sciences), and Rotch Library (Architecture and Planning). There is no single "main" library like Widener at Harvard, but rather a distributed system.

Residence Halls (Dorms): MIT has a diverse range of undergraduate residence halls, each with its own distinct culture and traditions. Examples include Baker House, Burton-Conner, East Campus, MacGregor House, Maseeh Hall, McCormick Hall (primarily women), New House, Next House, Random Hall, Simmons Hall, and West Campus (Bexley - closed, Fariborz Maseeh Hall). Graduate students have separate dormitories.
