Holistic & Rigorous Review: MIT seeks students who align with its mission and hands-on culture. Evaluation is rigorous and considers context.

Academic Preparation: Extremely strong foundation in math and science is critical. Success in the most challenging courses available (AP, IB, advanced classes) in calculus, physics, chemistry, and biology is expected. Strong performance in humanities, arts, and social sciences is also valued.

Standardized Tests:

SAT or ACT: Required (check policy for specific application year). While there's no official minimum, admitted students typically have exceptionally high scores, especially in Math sections.

English Proficiency (TOEFL, IELTS, etc.): Required for non-native English speakers, with high minimums/recommendations (e.g., TOEFL often recommended 100+).

Match with MIT's Mission: Demonstrated evidence of:

Collaborative and cooperative spirit.

Initiative, risk-taking, hands-on creativity (building things, coding, research, unique projects).

Passion for the MIT community and making an impact.

Strong ethical character.

Essays & Activities: Short answer essays are crucial for revealing personality, interests, and how the student matches MIT's values. The activities list should show depth, impact, and initiative.

Recommendations: Strong letters from a math/science teacher and a humanities/social science teacher providing specific examples of the student's academic ability, curiosity, and character. Counselor recommendation providing context about the school.
