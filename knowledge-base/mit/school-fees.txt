MIT, like Harvard, has a high sticker price but provides substantial need-based financial aid.

Undergraduate Cost of Attendance (COA) - 2024/2025 Estimate:

Tuition: ~$61,000 - $63,000

Fees (Student Life Fee): ~$400 - $500

Room and Board (Housing & Food): ~$19,000 - $21,000

Estimated Personal Expenses (Books, Supplies, Personal): ~$3,000 - $4,000

Total Estimated COA: ~$83,000 - $88,000+ per year before financial aid.

Financial Aid:

MIT practices need-blind admissions for all students (including international). Admission decisions are made without regard to financial circumstances.

MIT meets 100% of demonstrated financial need for all admitted students.

For families with incomes below a certain threshold (e.g., ~$140,000 with typical assets), tuition is often covered entirely by grant aid.

Aid packages consist of MIT Grants (no repayment needed) and student work expectations (no loans are included in the initial aid package, though students can choose to borrow).

(Note: These are estimates. Official figures are on the MIT Student Financial Services website.)
